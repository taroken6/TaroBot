# Budget App
Start date: June 05, 2020  
An entertainment bot that carries out user’s commands through asynchronous tasks for the messaging app ‘Discord’.  
The bot downloads YouTube URLs as mp3 files and queues it for playback.  
The bot also scrapes HTML from a website for mp3 files to be downloaded and played.

## Getting Started

First, you must have a Discord account and create your own bot through Discord's [Dev Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
Once you have created a bot, grab the bot's token and paste it into the 'TOKEN' variable in 'bot.py'
Run the bot through any IDE and you will be able to run commands on Discord.
